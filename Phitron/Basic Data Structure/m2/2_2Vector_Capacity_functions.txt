Capacity

v.size()  Returns the size of the vector. O(1)
v.max_size() Returns the maximum size that the vector can hold.O(1)
v.capacity() Returns the current available capacity of the vector. O(1)
v.clear()  Clears the vector elements. Do not delete the memory, only clear the value O(N)
v.empty()  Return true/false if the vector is empty or not. O(1)
v.resize() Change the size of the vector. O(K); where K is the difference between new size and current size.
