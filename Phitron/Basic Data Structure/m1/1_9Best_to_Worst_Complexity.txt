for best to wrost let n =1000

constant:     O(1)       = O(1)----->1
linear:       O(n)       = O(1000)--->4
logarithmic:  O(logn)    = O(10)----->2
sqrt:         O(sqrt(n)) = O(32)----->3
quadratic:    O(n*n)     = O(10^6)---->6
linearithmic: O(nlogn)   = O(10^5)---->5

constant>logarithmic>sqrt>linear>linearithmic>quadratic
