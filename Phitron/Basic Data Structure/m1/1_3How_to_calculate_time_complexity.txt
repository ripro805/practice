/*
omega is for best case
theta is for average case
big-O is for worst case



let"s take a array is 1 2 3 4 5
if we find 1 that will be the best case
if we find 3 that will be the average case
if we find 5 that will be the worst case


rules of time complexity calculation
1. Always take the worst case
2. ignore the constant  [for n it will be big-O(n)
                         for n-1 it will be big-O(n)
                         for 2n it will be big-O(n)]
