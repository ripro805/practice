1) Introduction
2) Variation of Graph
3) Representation
4) Vector of vector and Array of Vector
5) Array of vector vs vector of vector


                        row dynamic                 col dynamic


Array of vector               No                        Yes



Vector of vector              Yes                       YES



Note:
vector of vector --> vector<vector<int>>arr;
array of vector  --> vector<int>> arr[5];
